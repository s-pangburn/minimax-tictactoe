# minimax-tictactoe
Simple tic tac toe game with an AI opponent whose strategy is run by the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

The Minimax algorithm creates hypothetical game states and evaluates them using a simple scoring function to choose the best move based on what moves may or may not come after it. In this way, it "maximized" the AI opponent's chances of winning, while "minimizing" your chances of winning. Hence, "Minimax".
